    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p>
        Chicken Marsala is a classic Italian-American dish featuring tender chicken breasts lightly floured and pan-seared, 
        then smothered in a rich, savory sauce made with Marsala wine, mushrooms, and shallots. 
        The sauce, infused with earthy and slightly sweet notes from the fortified wine, 
        is velvety and aromatic, often finished with a touch of butter or cream for smoothness. 
        Typically served with pasta, mashed potatoes, or crusty bread, 
        this dish offers a comforting yet sophisticated balance of flavors.
